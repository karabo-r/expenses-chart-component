## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Most of the heavy lifting was done by the script, creating DOM elements and mapping them to a parent container which is a first since I'm used to hardcoded data.


I first had a problem with importing the json file from a different folder, and with struggling over 30+ minutes, I learned about the __assertion proposal__ and how it improved security when importing JSON modules and similar module types which cannot execute code.

```js
import myJson from './example.json' assert {type: 'json'};
```


### Continued development

I would like to improve on how I write my javscript logic and it's structure, did notice how messy and hard to understand it can be at times. And how to comment cause it could write a noval, it's that bad.
